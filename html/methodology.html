            In furtherance of her quest for increased citizens participation in governance in a manner that promotes transparency and
            accountability in the management of government finances and processes, the Public and Private Development Centre
            (PPDC) is expanding her transparency and anti-corruption program beyond federal government by working closely
            with relevant stakeholders at the sub-national level to institute a robust “Open State Government Ranking” (OSGR).
            The aim is to build on the achievement of the annual “Freedom of Information Ranking” which has encouraged Ministries,
            Departments and Agencies at the Federal level to improve on their compliance with the Freedom of Information
            Act, 2011.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Open State Government Ranking aims to encourage states to increase citizens participation in governance through publication
            of government held data and information. The ranking will be informed and guided by the level of State Governments
            commitment towards the promotion of transparency and accountability by making public information and data available
            on its website.
        </p>
        <p>
            The ranking will broadly consider the following fundamental criteria:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b> Open Government Partnership (OGP)</b>: Nigeria’s first National Action Plan makes provision for states
                    to sign up to the partnership. The National Steering Committee subsequently approved a Subnational Guidance
                    Note for states interested in signing up to the OGP. The ranking will highlight states that have followed
                    the steps listed in the guidance note or joined the global Subnational OGP, with the State’s Action Plan
                    (SAP) specifically addressing the OGP thematic areas like Fiscal Transparency, Anti- Corruption, Access
                    to Information and Citizens Engagement.

                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Open Budget</b>: Open Budget is critical for citizens participation in governance as it outlines government’s
                    revenue projection and spending plan for citizens. Availability of detailed breakdown of State Budget
                    on the State website will form the second criteria to be measured in this ranking. States that have their
                    2016, 2017 and 2018 budget breakdown published online stands a better chance in ranking.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Open Contracting</b>: Government business is handled through procurement either for provision of overhead
                    service or infrastructure. Open contracting process reduces corruption, ensures value for money and quality
                    service delivery; it provides opportunity for citizens to participate in governance through monitoring
                    of contracting process and implementation of contracts awarded by government. Availability of State Contractual
                    Information on the States website will form part of the criteria that will be measured in this ranking.
                </li>

                <b>Signatory to Open Government Partnership</b> - OGP is a new anti-corruption program crafted to secure government's
                commitments in promoting transparency, empower citizens and to fight against corruption. At the 2016 anti-corruption
                summit held in London, President Muhammadu Buhari reaffirmed his administration's commitment in the fight
                against corruption by signing up to OGP at the national level. Such commitment is equally desirable at the
                subnational level and States are encouraged to key into the program. Accordingly, a State will score
                <b> sixty (60) points upon signing to the program</b>.

                contractual details of each project carried out by the state each year and the information shall include
